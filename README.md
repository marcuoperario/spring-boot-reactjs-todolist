# Listify App
A full-stack application that utilizes the Spring Boot framework on the backend and React.js on the frontend to create a simple, yet functional todo list. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items in a user-friendly interface.

The following technologies were used:
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): A popular Java web framework for building robust, scalable, and secure web applications. Spring Boot is built on top of the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework), which provides a wide range of modules for building various components of web applications, such as Spring Web for building web applications, Spring Data for data access, and Spring Security for authentication and authorization.


- [Spring Web](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/web.html): A module of the Spring framework that provides support for building web applications.
- [Spring Data MongoDB](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb): A module of the Spring Framework that provides integration with the [MongoDB NoSQL database](https://www.mongodb.com/).
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): A Java library that helps reduce boilerplate code in Java classes.
- [React.js](https://react.dev/): A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that provides fast and efficient building and bundling of front-end applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build custom user interfaces.
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas): A fully managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB.
